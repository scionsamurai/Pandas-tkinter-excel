*The TRE regular expression implementation (src/regex/reg* and
*src/regex/tre*) is Copyright Â© 2001-2008 Ville Laurikari and licensed
*under a 2-clause BSD license (license text in the source files). The

*Copyright Â© 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
*Copyright Â© 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
*Copyright Â© 2008 Stephen L. Moshier
*and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
*have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.
*
*The ARM memcpy code (src/string/armel/memcpy.s) is Copyright Â© 2008
*The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD
*license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android.
*
*The implementation of DES for crypt (src/misc/crypt_des.c) is
*Copyright Â© 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license.
*
*The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/misc/crypt_blowfish.c) was
*originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public
*domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use
*in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain.
*
*The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright Â© 2011
*Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license.
*
*The BSD PRNG implementation (src/prng/random.c) and XSI search API
*(src/search/*.c) functions are Copyright Â© 2011 Szabolcs Nagy and
*licensed under following terms: "Permission to use, copy, modify,
*and/or distribute this code for any purpose with or without fee is
*hereby granted. There is no warranty."
*
*The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain. Several files (crt)
*were released into the public domain; others are licensed under the
*standard MIT license terms at the top of this file. See individual
*files for their copyright status.
*
*The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard
*Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted
*by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream
*integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
*
*The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington,
*and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed
*under the standard MIT terms.
*
*All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
*produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
*by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
*contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
*can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
*omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
*interest of source tree size.
*
*All public header files (include/* and arch/*/bits/*) should be
*treated as Public Domain as they intentionally contain no content
*which can be covered by copyright. Some source modules may fall in
*this category as well. If you believe that a file is so trivial that
*it should be in the Public Domain, please contact the authors and
*request an explicit statement releasing it from copyright.

*The following files are trivial, believed not to be copyrightable in
*the first place, and hereby explicitly released to the Public Domain:

**PSF_LICENSE
*A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
*==========================
*
*Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
*Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
*as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
*principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
*
*In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
*National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
*in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
*software.
*
*In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
*BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
*year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
*Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
*Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
*non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
*Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
*the PSF.
*
*All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
*the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
*releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
*the various releases.

*Footnotes:
*
*(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
*    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
*    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
*    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
*    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
*
*(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
*    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
*    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
*    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
*
*Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
*direction to make these releases possible.

*Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of
*the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
*License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that

*provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
*modifying the License.
*You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide

*and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
*liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
*or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
*out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to

*Bootloader Exception
*--------------------
*
*In addition to the permissions in the GNU General Public License, the
*authors give you unlimited permission to link or embed compiled bootloader
*and related files into combinations with other programs, and to distribute
*those combinations without any restriction coming from the use of those
*files. (The General Public License restrictions do apply in other respects;
*for example, they cover modification of the files, and distribution when
*not linked into a combined executable.)
* 
* 
*Bootloader and Related Files
*----------------------------
*
*Bootloader and related files are files which are embedded within the
*final executable. This includes files in directories:
*
*./bootloader/
*./PyInstaller/loader
*
*
*Run-time Hooks
*----------------------------
*
*Run-time Hooks are a different kind of files embedded within the final
*executable. To ease moving them into a separate repository, or into the
*respective project, these file are now licensed under the Apache License,
*Version 2.0.
*
*Run-time Hooks are in the directory
*./PyInstaller/hooks/rthooks
*

*Our Copyright Policy
*--------------------
*
*PyInstaller uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
*over their contributions to PyInstaller. But, it is important to note that these
*contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus,
*the PyInstaller source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single
*person or institution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire
*PyInstaller Development Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain
*a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they
*should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they
*commit the change to the PyInstaller repository.
*
*With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file

*		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
*		       Version 2, June 1991
*
* Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
* 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA
* Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
* of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
*
*			    Preamble
*
*  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
*freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
*License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
*software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
*General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
*Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
*using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
*the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
*your programs, too.
*
*  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
*price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
*have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
*this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
*if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
*in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
*
*  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
*anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
*These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
*distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
*
*  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
*gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
*you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
*source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
*rights.
*
*  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
*(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
*distribute and/or modify the software.
*
*  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
*that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
*software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
*want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
*that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
*authors' reputations.
*
*  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
*patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
*program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
*program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
*patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
*
*  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
*modification follow.
*
*		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
*   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
*
*  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
*a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
*under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
*refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
*means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
*that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
*either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
*language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
*the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
*
*Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
*covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
*running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
*is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
*Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
*Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
*
*  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
*source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
*conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
*copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
*notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
*and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
*along with the Program.
*
*You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
*you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
*
*  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
*of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
*distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
*above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
*
*    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
*    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
*
*    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
*    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
*    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
*    parties under the terms of this License.
*
*    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
*    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
*    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
*    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
*    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
*    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
*    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
*    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
*    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
*    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
*
*These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
*identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
*and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
*themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
*sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
*distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
*on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
*this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
*entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
*
*Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
*your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
*exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
*collective works based on the Program.
*
*In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
*with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
*a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
*the scope of this License.
*
*  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
*under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
*Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
*
*    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
*    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
*    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
*
*    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
*    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
*    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
*    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
*    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
*    customarily used for software interchange; or,
*
*    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
*    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
*    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
*    received the program in object code or executable form with such
*    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
*
*The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
*making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
*code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
*associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
*control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
*special exception, the source code distributed need not include
*anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
*form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
*operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
*itself accompanies the executable.
*
*If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
*access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
*access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
*distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
*compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
*
*  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
*except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
*otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
*void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
*However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
*this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
*parties remain in full compliance.
*
*  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
*signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
*distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
*prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
*modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
*Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
*all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
*the Program or works based on it.
*
*  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
*Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
*original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
*these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
*restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
*You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
*this License.
*
*  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
*infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
*conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
*otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
*excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
*distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
*License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
*may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
*license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
*all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
*the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
*refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
*
*If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
*any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
*apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
*circumstances.
*
*It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
*patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
*such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
*integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
*implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
*generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
*through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
*system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
*to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
*impose that choice.
*
*This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
*be a consequence of the rest of this License.
*
*  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
*certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
*original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
*may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
*those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
*countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
*the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
*
*  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
*of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
*be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
*address new problems or concerns.
*
*Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
*specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
*later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
*either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
*Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
*this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
*Foundation.
*
*  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
*programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
*to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
*Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
*make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
*of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
*of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
*
*			    NO WARRANTY
*
*  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
*FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
*OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
*PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
*OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
*MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
*TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
*PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
*REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
*
*  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
*WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
*REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
*INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
*OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
*TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
*YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
*PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
*POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

*
*      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
*      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
*      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
*      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
*
*      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
*      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
*      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
*      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
*      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

*      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
*      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
*      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
*
*      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
*      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
*      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
*
*   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
*      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
*      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
*      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
*      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
*      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
*
*   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
*      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

*      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
*      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
*      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
*      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
*      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
*      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
*      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
*      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
*      as of the date such litigation is filed.
*
*   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
*      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
*      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
*      meet the following conditions:
*
*      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
*          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
*
*      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
*          stating that You changed the files; and
*
*      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
*          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
*          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
*          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
*          the Derivative Works; and
*
*      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
*          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
*          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
*          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
*          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
*          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
*          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
*          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
*          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
*          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
*          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
*          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
*          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
*          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
*          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
*          as modifying the License.
*
*      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
*      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
*      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
*      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
*      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
*      the conditions stated in this License.
*
*   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
*      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
*      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
*      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
*      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
*      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
*      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
*
*   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
*      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
*      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
*      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
*
*   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
*      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
*      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
*      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
*      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
*      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
*      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
*      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
*      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
*
*   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
*      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
*      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
*      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
*      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
*      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
*      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
*      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
*      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
*      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
*      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
*
*   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
*      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
*      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
*      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
*      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
*      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
*      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
*      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
*      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
*      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
